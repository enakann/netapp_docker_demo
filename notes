What is docker:
---------------
Docker is a platform or ecosystem around
creating and running containers


Docker client
Docker server
Docker Machine
Docker Images
Docker Hub
Docker Compose


docker run redis --> docker cli(docker client) ----> Docker server(docker daemon) ---> docker hub --> redis Image: Single file with all deps  ---------> container(instance of image,runs a program)
																								and config required to run specific a program(redis)
										            Docker server looked for image in local cache
											
										
container - Instance of an image
            Program with isolated set of resources
			(memory,network,hard drive)
